# Whistle Stop App

App made for the Winter Station 2022 Submission, for Concordia's SCUL398 Public Art

The App was made with [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe)

## Project Statement

Approach the structure and begin to hear its soft singing, calling in. Enter and find a calm, protective space, guarded from the bite of the winter air. Structures have the capacity to hinder growth or to become a stage for resilience. Whistle Stop is an interactive sculptural installation that translates the harsh winter wind into a protective and sonic experience. The shell-like form of the installation is composed of multiple tuned pipes, played by the wind. Inside is a place to sit, to rest, to commune, to hide from, and collaborate with the wind, in solitude or with friends. Experience it from home using the AR app, explore the sounds from your own place of comfort. Wintering in Canada is a practice of hopping from refuge to refuge, from warmth to warmth. Our hope with Whistle Stop is to show how certain structures make possible our capacity to be resilient.
